# [Laravel] wallpapers by [@msurguy]

Need some cool wallpapers and love Laravel? 
I present to you Laravel wallpapers.

##What does this do as far as coding?   
Nothing. This is simply for viewing pleasure.

## How to get this thing running? 
You have few options:
- You can deploy in the cloud by means of hiring an airplane with colorful smoke
- You can hire a painter to paint this over a large building somewhere in your city
- You can just use your system settings to change the wallpaper


## Show me examples!
Here you go:
